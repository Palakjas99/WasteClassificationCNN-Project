# CNN Model for Plastic waste Classification
# Overview
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of plastic waste into various categories. The primary goal is to enhance waste management systems by improving the segregation and recycling process using deep learning technologies.

Sure! Here’s a brief overview of a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model applied to plastic waste management, which you can use for your GitHub project. I’ll also include some ideas for how you might organize your repository and what to include in the README.

Project Overview: Plastic Waste Management using CNN
This project focuses on using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify and categorize plastic waste from images. The goal is to automate the process of classifying various types of plastic waste, enabling more efficient recycling processes and better waste management practices.

#Key Components:
Image Dataset:
A dataset of plastic waste images, labeled with different plastic types (e.g., PET, PVC, HDPE) or waste categories (e.g., bottles, wrappers, packaging). This dataset can either be custom-made or sourced from available open datasets.

Preprocessing:
The image data is preprocessed to standardize input dimensions and normalize pixel values for the CNN. Common techniques may include resizing images, image augmentation, and normalization.

CNN Architecture:
A Convolutional Neural Network is designed to detect relevant features in the images, classify them, and output the category of plastic waste. This could involve using a simple CNN or more advanced architectures like ResNet or VGG.

Model Training and Evaluation:
The CNN model is trained on the dataset using appropriate loss functions and optimization algorithms. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are used to evaluate the model’s performance.

Deployment:
Once the model is trained and validated, it can be deployed for real-time plastic waste classification, where it could be integrated into a mobile app or web application for use by waste management companies or even individuals.
